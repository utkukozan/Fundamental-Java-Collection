    // The main goal of object-oriented programming is to eliminate code repetition.
    // For example, objects like BMW, Volvo, Mercedes can be defined for the car class. Each object will have its own properties.
    // Classes can be created using the "class" keyword. The code above creates the ObjectName class (Line: 1).
